The reason for a separate unit here is that the set of all possibilities, $\\Omega$ is infinite, while the dataset $\\{ D \\}$ is a finite **sample** from $\\Omega$. Hence, it is **not true** that if we have a dataset that shows \"$D$ has, so far, happened 70% of the time\" is equal to \"$D$ is 70% of $\\Omega$\".
